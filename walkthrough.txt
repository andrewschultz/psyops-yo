Psyops Yo isn't intended to be deep, but that first point may be tricky.

The point here is to find letters or letter groups that expand shorter words. For instance, Rub might become Aruba.

There are three points above ground and three points below. You can get the ones above in any order. You get a point by retrieving an item and then bringing it to the room where it can be used.

The game map is a triangle to start, with a path inward/down to the final center room later.

You only need one below ground to win, but it's not the best one.

With that in mind, you have a cap to help someone flee.

Ale, now.

Another hat. To make you a good person.

Now you need to go down, and you hear you are a CAD.

> D

> ABRACADABRA

You can just go down now to get the okay ending.

But there is a command you can use on the Apple, or one you can use to get the good ending.

What can you do with "rate?"

What can you do with "d?" The word is probably slangier than abracadabra.
