Psyops Yo isn't intended to be deep, but that first point may be tricky.

The point here is to find letters or letter groups that expand shorter words. For instance, Rub might become Aruba.

There are three points above ground and three points below. You can get the ones above in any order. You get a point by retrieving an item and then bringing it to the room where it can be used.

The game map is a triangle to start, with a path inward/down to the final center room later once you've dealt with all three rooms aboveground.

You only need one command below ground to win, but it's not the best one.

With that in mind, you see a cap to help someone, maybe yourself flee. You can't help the alkie right now.

> ESCAPES

> NE

Ale, now.

> STALEST

> SE

You get rid of the men automatically with the cape.

But what to do with the hat? To help someone be a better person?

> MAHATMA

Now you need to touch base with the other two people/entities hanging around, or the second passage below won't open.

> W

> NE

Now you need to go down, and you hear you are a CAD.

> D

> ABRACADABRA

You can just go down now to get the okay ending.

But there is a command you can use on the Apple, or one you can use to get the good ending.

What can you do with "rate?"

Then, what can you do with "d?" The word is probably slangier than abracadabra.
