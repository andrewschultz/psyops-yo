https://andrewschultz.itch.io/psyops-yo has a binary you can play, or a browser game.

ifarchive.org should have the latest version as well.

I foresee very few additional updates after March 1st, 2025. However, if you see significant commits after that, there may be a maintenance release.

Version 3 is the latest release.
