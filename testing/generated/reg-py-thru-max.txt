Yes, it's a bit reflexive and self-referential. But it's worth a try. And, equally hokey, the well swells!
As you climb down, you wind up finding a secret passage that leads ... somewhere new. You feel smart immediately when you arrive, unable to suppress an "I DID! I DID!" and needing no estates tat with a legible gib. Why, you don't even need to visit the Smiles Mile you see!
Of course it's easy to feel all this, walking on ...
EINSTEIN ST.
Now, where to visit first? Re: area, there are HELF shelfs (a hat-tip to that one Far Side comic,) and a credit union called Trust-R-Us to help new people get acclimated. Then, perhaps that restaurant called Yo, BYOB, or L'Salsa, or the snack shop Ho, Choc. In other establishments that'd please any ate-rater, hotshots eat couscous, or maybe mahi mahi, or even spies' pie. Some tout stouts to ward off beriberi. Under a chiquichiqui and mingimingi and rewa-rewa.
You make your choice. If there was better, you don't care. You can't help feeling like ...
