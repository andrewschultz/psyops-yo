#this is the main dump for basic verb commands
>think
THINK is used for commands you figured but did in the wrong order or place.
There's nothing you figured in advance that you need to do later.

>think
!THINK is
There's nothing you figured in advance that you need to do later.

>i
You're wearing that scowls cowl, and it's a total drag.
You haven't found anything that might help you. Stuff is lying around, but you haven't tried to take it yet.

>no
Discord is ... (cor!)

>yes
A yay! A yay!

>z
Meantime? ... ANTI!

>xyzzy
Hark! Sharks!
*** You have died ***
But wait, you were resurrected! Someone raised a...
... puts on shades ...
fund of undo!

>talk cap
You don't need to talk to anyone or anything, though people may give some silly response.

>take cap
You reach for the cap, but you feel resistance. What is going on? Another look, and, well, it just seems too plain as-is. Maybe if you jazzed it up, it would be more worth taking, or feel more worth being taken.

>i
You haven't found anything that might help you. Stuff is lying around, but you were unable to just scoop it up.

>x alkie
Like so many people who drink a lot, the Alkie may both want a drink and want an excuse never to want a drink again.

>talk alkie
"If you could find something that'd turn me off alcohol forever, that'd be awesome! Why, I'd take it from your hands before you had a chance to give it to me."

>take suns
Sadly, the un-suns leave you feeling so helpless you can't do much more than examine them. So you do.
They're totally, like, dark and gloomy and stuff. Just the thought of them makes you think, "O, wow!" They're so dark, you wonder if they could be called tar stars, too.

>take gulf
Sadly, the Ingulfin' Gulf leaves you feeling so helpless you can't do much more than examine it. So you do.
Ingraining rain slowly keeps filling it up, limiting your travel options to north, northeast and east. You think you yourself "ew, dew'd" at the prospect of touching it. Probably filled with slices-lice, with a trap-pit of ever-severs below.

>take rain
Sadly, the ingraining rain leaves you feeling so helpless you can't do much more than examine it. So you do.
Although it isn't terribly gaudy or acidic looking rain, but it's enough to prevent you from straying.

>take rim
Sadly, the primp rim leaves you feeling so helpless you can't do much more than examine it. So you do.

>attack cap
Ai! Maim?! (Violence is not the keyword. You have no kill-skills.)

>listen
Random spooky taunts:
!them all

>listen
Random spooky taunts:
!them all

>listen
Random spooky taunts:

>listen
Random spooky taunts:

>smell
Ethene, then...

>sing
A tune you've never heard before comes in your head. You know it instinctively to be On, Sons.

>hit
You think, pejoratively, of people who really were pretty awful. But you don't need violent fantasies and name-calling right now.

>hit cap
You think, pejoratively, of people who really were pretty awful. But you don't need violent fantasies and name-calling right now.

>d
There'll be passage down, but you haven't discovered enough.

>s
You try to, but you realize such idle sidles might lead into ... the INGULFIN' GULF. You can, however, go north, northeast and east.

>talk me
You give yourself a chic "Hi" ... at "orator."

>z
Meantime? ... ANTI!

>e
Tormentor men stand here. They aren't even throwing light slights at you ... at least not while you're looking. They definitely go in for a gag.

>attack men
They'd run you through a slaps-lap, or worse.

>talk men
"Derider?! I?!" they all respond individually. Then, "Ain't saints!"
It's annoying, being a sheesh-ee, but at least they're not attacking you. Maybe it's more fun for them to drag things out. Perhaps you could lure them into chasing after something that can't be tormented. They'd probably jump before you know it. If they were French, they'd definitely, be a quip-equipe, with voices smooth as Le Oleo.

>shit
The tormentor men mock you with "Un-taunt a..."

>x men
They are wearing mock-smocks indicating they all live in the same attentat tent. If they were female, perhaps they would be wearing oppressive tsarist saris. You're a bit surprised they're not wearing carve-scarves.
You feel momentary relief not one of them is a Getting-Ettin, looking to maul you. But you still want them to just go.

>x men
They are wearing mock-smocks indicating they all live in the same attentat tent. If they were female, perhaps they would be wearing oppressive tsarist saris. You're a bit surprised they're not wearing carve-scarves.
!You feel momentary relief

>x smocks
Even looking at them makes you feel insulted.

>x cap
The way the cap lies on the ground suggests it's being held. It's not of particularly stiff material, but it's standing straight up.

>escapes
by one point

>x cap
It's not trying to escape you, but maybe it will help you escape a tough situation.

>drop cap
You never need to drop anything in Psyops, Yo. Items no longer useful should vanish.

>x suns
!Sadly,
They're a little less gloomy now you've got your bearings.

>x cowl
It makes you feel down, and you can't pull it off. It feels less oppressive now you've helped yourself a bit.
!You imagine a faux-cheery voice

>i
You're wearing that scowls cowl, and it's a considerable drag.
You have found a raider-aide: the escapes cap.
!You have successfully used

>ne

>take ale
You reach for the ale, but you feel resistance. What is going on? Another look, and, well, it just seems too plain as-is. Maybe if you jazzed it up, it would be more worth taking, or feel more worth being taken.

>listen
There's a gong on somewhere.

>n
You try to, but you realize such idle sidles might lead into ... the INGULFIN' GULF. You can, however, go south, southeast, southwest and down.

>x ale
It's plain, as if it could become more or less palatable, for better or worse.

>stalest
by one point

>i
You're wearing that scowls cowl, and it's a bit of a drag.
You have found a raider-aide. Well, two: the stalest ale and the escapes cap.

>x ale
It doesn't look especially menacing, but you really don't want to drink it.

>x cowl
It makes you feel down, and you can't pull it off. You barely feel it now, but you can't throw it off just yet.

>se

>d
Dwell'd Well

>d
You can't go further down. At least, not now, you can't.

>undo
>undo

>take hat
You reach for the hat, but you feel resistance. What is going on? Another look, and, well, it just seems too plain as-is. Maybe if you jazzed it up, it would be more worth taking, or feel more worth being taken.

>listen
An um-pump hidden from view builds tension.

>s
You try to, but you realize such idle sidles might lead into ... the INGULFIN' GULF. You can, however, go north, northwest, west and down.

>i
You're wearing that scowls cowl, and it's a bit of a drag.
You have found a raider-aide: the stalest ale.
You have successfully used a raider-aide: the escapes cap.

>x hat
The hat is impressive looking, yet it repels you a bit, as if you need to find out its meaning or purpose.

>mahatma
by one point

>x hat
The hat is impressive and all, but it's not your style. You need to find someone it fits.

>i
You aren't carrying anything. You're even free of that scowls cowl! You can't see anything worth taking. You just need to find a way out.

>u
The way forward is down, not up.

>x suns
!Sadly,
They're much less gloomy now you've sorted things out aboveground.

>x cowl
You can't see any such thing.

>w

>d

>abracadabra
Nothing magical happens. V or VERBS gives Psyops, Yo's pared-down command list as well as pointers on commands that make progress.

>undo
>undo

>ne

>d

>listen
"Cad! Cad!"

>d
"Cad ... cad ..." that voice continues. You need to shake it off.

>u

>abracadabra
This is not the right place. You need to be somewhere you can open a new passage.

>think
You know you need to say ABRACADABRA somewhere.

>d

>abracadabra
by one point

>think
!ABRACADABRA
There's nothing you figured in advance that you need to do later.

>undo

The only vertical passage is in Dwell'd Well.

>abracadabra
by one point
Perhaps it is time to go down.

>i
You aren't carrying anything. You're even free of that scowls cowl! You can't see anything worth taking. Being unburdened with stuff will be handy to make the journey down a bit quicker. You hope.

>attack shelf
No need to create an ex-text.

>listen
Random spooky taunts

>x cowl
You can't see any such thing.

>okeydokey
Yes! You're excited! But you run down too fast. The last thing you see is a princess, whose "Huh, U?!" expression (or is it "Bub, U...") and martial-arts move leaves you doubled over, fatally injured. Your last words are "Shadows had ... OW!"
*** You have died ***
Okay, not really. But if you want the good ending, I'm gonna force you to name that ancient Apple IIe game. It's a classic, even with the instadeath and inability to save at the end.

>smell
ROM aroma.

>x apple
The Apple IIe has the word RATE written across it in orange. You obviously don't have time for silly games right now, but if you did, maybe there's a game you could rate!

>talk apple
It's not some newfangled yappy app.

>x aura
It's sort of all around you. You can't do anything with it, but it makes you feel empowered. Hopefully with no hubris.

>think
You would really like to say OKEY DOKEY, with or without a space, with proper prep.

>karateka
by one point

>d
Hey, wait. OKEYDOKEY would work now. You should say that, instead.
!Ingoing

>think
!ABRACADABRA

>okeydokey
by one point

Yes, it's a bit reflexive and self-referential. But it's worth a try. And, equally hokey, the well swells!
As you climb down, you wind up finding a secret passage that leads ... somewhere new. You feel smart immediately when you arrive, unable to suppress an "I DID! I DID!" and needing no estates tat with a legible gib. Why, you don't even need to visit the Smiles Mile you see!
Of course it's easy to feel all this, walking on ...
EINSTEIN ST.
Now, where to visit first? Re: area, there are HELF shelfs (a hat-tip to that one Far Side comic,) and a credit union called Trust-R-Us to help new people get acclimated. Then, perhaps that restaurant called Yo, BYOB, or L'Salsa, or the snack shop Ho, Choc. In other establishments that'd please any ate-rater, hotshots eat couscous, or maybe mahi mahi, or even spies' pie. Some tout stouts to ward off beriberi. Under a chiquichiqui and mingimingi and rewa-rewa.
You make your choice. If there was better, you don't care. You can't help feeling like ...
*** A MUCKAMUCK! ***
