A slogs-log by MP Kempke and Hamish Amis
Release 4
You're at the southwest corner of an equilateral triangle of open spaces. The two un-suns hang menacingly in the sky, blotting things out and causing general depression and dreariness. Passages through the Ingulfin' Gulf lead north (or northeast) and east. A primp-rim is wedged between those two passages, some odd direction between east and northeast.
"Uh, hi, I'm the stalkiest alkie! People told me a pejorative like that would finally help me get it through my thick head to drink less, but somehow it made me drink more. Guess I'm stuck with it, though, unless someone can help me."
A cap sits on the ground here. Its brim seems stuck.
[NOTE: Psyops, Yo requires specific unusual commands to win. You may wish to type ABOUT to find out more or VERBS to see a list of useful or needed verbs. You may also get clues from walking around or from, well, the introductory text]

Ingraining rain slowly keeps filling it up, limiting your travel options to north, northeast and east. You think you yourself "ew, dew'd" at the prospect of touching it. Probably filled with slices-lice, with a trap-pit of ever-severs below.

Not dazzling, but frankly, you're relieved not to be wearing a tutu or muumuu or ew-sews, which you never considered existed until now. You don't have a tat.

>about
Psyops, Yo was an entry to the EctoComp 2021 Petite Mort. It was originally conceived for 2020, but life got in the way. I'd had bigger plans, which took away from fun small stuff like this.
The game is solvable in nine moves, though there are two bonus points.
Source control is at https://github.com/andrewschultz/psyops-yo.
VERSIONS shows version information. CREDITS shows credits. EXT shows extensions used. Abbreviations work, too.
Psyops, Yo requires word-guessing to win. However, I hope to make the mechanic obvious if you examine or walk around enough. There's a certain pattern to it all.
\\
>credits
I'd like to thank Olaf Nowacki for moral support during the original testing run-up--I left no time for testing. He had an entry in the Petite Mort too! Oh, and the IFComp 2021 authors' subforum. Several of them entered something, too!
I would also like to thank JJ Guest for creating EctoComp, Duncan Bowsman for stepping in and Ruber Eaglenest for running it in 2021 (and before and after,) and itch.io for hosting EctoComp and other comps that help me just remember to play others' stuff.
Wade Clarke and A. DiBianca sent transcripts which helped make version 4 more polished.

Psyops, Yo has a very simplified parser. You can win just by going in the standard directions, including diagonals, and by guessing magic words based on objects lying around and saying them, with or without the object name.
Two useful diagnostic commands are SCORE for score, which also gives non-spoilery nudges, and I for inventory, though you won't need to carry much. Other meta-commands include ABOUT, CREDITS, EXT and VERSIONS, which have abbreviations.
TALKing is also an option but unnecessary to win, and you can type T NPC, or TALK NPC or TALK TO NPC. No subject is actually needed, since no room has more than one NPC.
Some other standard Inform commands are implemented as jokes: for instance, the senses. But none are critical to winning the game, though AMUSING will list them once you've won.

Version 1 was released October 30, 2021 to Itch.io for the yearly EctoComp competition, Petite Mort division.
Version 2 was released February 28, 2025 to Itch.io with no new technical features, but with minor bug fixes and also "appropriate" text that trickled in over the years. Since then, Martin Amis, whose name cued Hamish, had left this world for over a year. RIP.
Version 3 was released March 1, 2025 to Itch.io with the Elite Lit/bookshelf in the final area containing random books.
Version 4 was released January 3, 2026 to Itch.io with bug fixes and clarifications. La Palapa and a list of (un)invited people are also in place at the end.
No further updates are planned, but if enough bugs are found, I may roll up a maintenance release.

It's annoying, being a sheesh-ee, but at least they're not attacking you. Maybe it's more fun for them to drag things out. Perhaps you could lure them into chasing after something that can't be tormented. They'd probably jump before you know it.

You're at the southeast corner of an equilateral triangle of open spaces. The two un-suns hang menacingly in the sky, blotting things out and causing general depression and dreariness. Passages through the Ingulfin' Gulf lead north (or northwest) and west. There's also a way down between them, in a direction too diagonal for this parser, so just go DOWN when ready.
Tormentor men stand here. They aren't even throwing light slights at you ... at least not while you're looking. They definitely go in for a gag.
You've been around everywhere. Elapse, laps, you think to yourself.
A tall narrow hat, not looking very special, lies here. The top sways in the wind, but the bottom seems quite stiff. It feels like someone great could have worn it, great enough to inspire a nation, yet it's too plain right now.
The Tormentor Men squint at your escapes cap. They start with the usual insults, but you deflect them with yawny aw'n. They're actually a bit impressed. They say it must be the cap, but the cap ... escapes after a breeze blows it away. The Tormentor Men go chasing after it, because they can't have anyone else wearing it and failing to heed them. The cap blows far away, taking the Tormentor Men with.

You hear lightning. You wonder briefly if it is about to strike you down because abracadabra isn't a real-real word.
But you remain standing. Eh, you could probably beat yourself up until Black Friday over whether or not you had enough style points, here. You feel different, as if encompassed by something supernatural.
Dirt is cleared away to reveal a rod and lid beneath the well. They look plain, but you know the rod must be an erode-rod. As for the lid?
You incant "ELIDE!"
A hole opens up below! It's in the shape of a D, which suggests you can just go (D) for down.
And yet ... perhaps you can get style points ... for that, or the mysterious dappled Apple computer which appeared in the hole. Funny, you'd have expected Le Coleco.
But it's not all that appears. You can also, if you like, distract yourself with a bookshelf labeled (of course) Elite Lit.
A place called La Palapa has its entrance blocked, and an Able Tablet appears on the side of the well, listing curious names.
You also feel you've acquired (and earned) an ur-aura!
Perhaps it is time to go further down.
Your score has just gone up by one point.

There are three ways to go back up, here: north, southwest, and southeast. Typing U or UP will lead you back the way you just came, to the Ur-Church. But there's nothing more to do aboveground, so you probably want to go D or DOWN now you've found a way.
The way down is a huge hole in the shape of a D--voices from it seem to say "Suss us." You could probably just go down through the D-shaped hole and get on with things, but maybe you can be fancy about it. An ancient dappled Apple home computer sits next to it.
The bookshelf, aka Elite Lit, also stands here to distract you, if you need that. Next to it is an Able Tablet full of random author names. La Palapa is here, too, not that you an enter it, but you can examine it or read U DUD/NOT, SNOTS to see (un)-invitees.

You aren't carrying anything. You're even free of that scowls cowl! You can't see anything worth taking. Being unburdened with stuff will be handy to make the journey down a bit quicker. You hope.

OK-APOSTROPHE: "Ingoing, O!" you shout as you explore further down...
OK-APOSTROPHE: ...and you land with a "Lo, Plop" in ...
OK-APOSTROPHE: ...Saves Ave. It is a nice enough place to live. People seem to appreciate you. Things are okay, for about a week. Then... then, you realize you are just a block over from Raver Ave leading to the shills' hill and scamps' camp beyond. It's not so bad at first, but the raves get bigger and bigger as time goes on, fueled by alt-salts, illicit hoot-shoots, and many a turnt urn. Everyone greets the host with a "Shucks, Huck," though you're never in a good enough mood to. They suggest celebrities to invite, too: "Flavor Flav, or ... ?"
As time goes on, people reflexively wave away your unsocial behavior with yawny aw'n.
Not that it's the worst place to live, and nobody threatens to relocate you to the hack shacks on Grun-G-Run, but you sense this was the lesser of the possible ending-sendings.
ME: HM?! EH?!

>okeydokey
Yes! You're excited! But you run down too fast. The last thing you see is a princess, whose "Huh, U?!" expression (or is it "Bub, U...") and martial-arts move leaves you doubled over, fatally injured. Your last words are "Shadows had ... OW!"
*** You have died ***
Okay, not really. But if you want the good ending, I'm gonna force you to name that ancient Apple game. It's a classic, even with the instadeath and inability to save at the end.
\\
>smell
ROM aroma.
\\
>x apple
It's an ancient Apple home computer, dappled all over, but it still seems to be running okay. It has the word RATE written across it in orange. You obviously don't have time for silly games right now, but if you did, maybe there's a game you could rate!
\\
>talk apple
It's not some newfangled yappy app.
\\
>x aura
It's sort of all around you. You can't do anything with it, but it makes you feel empowered. Hopefully with no hubris.

You would really like to say OKEY DOKEY, with or without a space, with proper prep.

Hey, wait. OKEYDOKEY would work now. You should say that, instead.

@det
Boy, you sure could go for a game of Karateka now. You're a bit more apprehensive of running into the hole, now, as there may be a princess waiting to deck you on the other side.
As you contemplate this, the dappled Apple sadly, blows up. But hey, there's always emulation, and save states are handy for if you mess up, anyway.

You feel like you can enter the D-shaped hole with pizzazz and flair now, not just going down.

Total score: 5 / 6. You have five points and can now take the fancy way down for an extra special ending. Or just go down for a regular win.

Yes, it's a bit reflexive and self-referential. But it's worth a try. And, equally hokey, the well swells!
As you climb down, you wind up finding a secret passage that leads ... somewhere new. You feel smart immediately when you arrive, unable to suppress an "I DID! I DID!" and needing no estates tat with a legible gib. Why, you don't even need to visit the Smiles Mile you see!
Of course it's easy to feel all this, walking on ...
EINSTEIN ST.
Now, where to visit first? Re: area, there are HELF shelfs (a hat-tip to that one Far Side comic,) and a credit union called Trust-R-Us to help new people get acclimated. Then, perhaps that restaurant called Yo, BYOB, or L'Salsa, or the snack shop Ho, Choc. In other establishments that'd please any ate-rater, hotshots eat couscous, or maybe mahi mahi, or even spies' pie. Some tout stouts to ward off beriberi. Under a chiquichiqui and mingimingi and rewa-rewa.
You make your choice. If there was better, you don't care. You can't help feeling like ...
*** A MUCKAMUCK! ***

@meta
>amusing
Here is a list of things you can try. I didn't keep track of if you did, even though Psyops, Yo was a short game, but then again, since it's short, it'll be easier to check off on all these phrases.
YES, NO, SING, or WAIT/Z give a fixed response.
There are also responses for naughty words like BOTHER and the semi-custom verb HIT.
Some verbs have a generic and specific response:
ATTACK gives a slightly different response for the Tormentor Men or Elite Lit.
SMELL is slightly different near the end, with the Apple nearby.
LISTEN is slightly different in the Row, the Church and (with 3 points) the Well than other places.
The empty command, asking to RESTORE a game (before and after,) and UNDO also give custom text.
Oh, of course, XYZZY has a silly response, too.
